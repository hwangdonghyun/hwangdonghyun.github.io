## Abstract
In this work, we present an analysis tool to help golf beginners compare their swing motion with experts' swing motion. The proposed application synchronizes videos with different swing phase timings using the latent features extracted by a neural network-based encoder and detects key frames where discrepant motions occur. We visualize synchronized image frames and 3D poses that help users recognize the difference and the key factors that can be important for their swing skill improvement.
