## Abstract
We propose MlioLight, a projector-camera unit-based projection-mapping system for overlaying multiple images on a screen or on real world objects using multiple flashlight-type devices. We focus on detecting the areas of overlapping lights in a multiple light source scenario and overlaying multi-layered information on real world objects in these areas. To blend multiple images, we developed methods for light identification and overlapping area detection using wireless synchronization between a high-speed camera and multiple flashlight devices. In this study, we describe the concept of MlioLight as well as its prototype implementation and applications. In addition, we present an evaluation of the proposed prototype.
