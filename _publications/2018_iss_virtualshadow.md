## Abstract
In this work, we propose a golf training system using real-time visual feedback. The system projects the virtual shadow of the user on the ground in front of the user; this shadow provides feedback to the user without form collapse. Additionally, an expert's contour is overlaid on the virtual shadow of the user to make them aware of the difference between their form and that of the expert. In this system, the user can receive feedback with a fixed face orientation according to the actual golf swing; such feedback cannot be realized in systems projecting feedbacks on a wall. Moreover, by imitating the shadows already used in conventional golf training, the cost of adaptation to this training system can be reduced.
