## Abstract
Spatial and temporal clues found in a professionalâ€™s motion are essential for designing a training system for learning a motor skill. We investigate the potential of using neural networks to learn spatial and temporal features of advanced players in sports and to detect the fine-grained differences between motions. As a training system, we implement an AI Coach prototype application that finds the differences between two input motions and visualizes a recommendation motion for the users to correct their forms. In the user study, we investigate the effects of the proposed AI Coach and discuss the findings based on quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews. In the study, the proposed system can help the user better understand the difference between them and the coach. The study also reveals the necessity of coaching beginners in the early learning phases.
